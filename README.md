## A simple quote generator

* This goal for this side project was to create a quote generator specifically by/for creatives

### Getting Started

* Compile SASS from the styles folder using:

```bash
# Compiles main.scss and spits output in root directory
$ sass --watch main.scss:../output.css --style compressed

```

### To-dos:

* Set-up gulp build to compile SASS to run through autoprefixer
